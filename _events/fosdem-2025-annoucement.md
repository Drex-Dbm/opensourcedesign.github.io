## FOSDEM 2025 has been annouced and we are excited for another in-person Open Source Design devroom! 


*FOSDEM is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate. Every year, thousands of developers of free and open source software from all over the world gather at the event in Brussels. You don't need to register. Just turn up and join in!*


Join us in Brussels, Belgium for design talks, discussion and fun! Here's everything you need to know about getting to the Open Source Design devroom at FOSDEM. ðŸŽ‰

The Open Source Design community groups welcomes and encourages folks from both design and non-design backgrounds to submit talks related to design to the dev room and attend the talks in the devroom. If you'd like a buddy or someone to chat to before joining us you can check out our [discourse forum](https://discourse.opensourcedesign.net).

We'll be opening up the **call for proposals/talks** very soon. We will **close** the call for proposals/talks on **November 31st 2024** will go through a round of reviews by the [open source design core team](https://discourse.opensourcedesign.net/t/open-source-design-core-team/888) and you'll get a notification of acceptance or rejection in early to mid December 2024.


## I can't attend but how can I support Open Source Design?

We opened a specific Open Collective fund to support speakers to attend and speak on open source design topics this year - you can donate directly to that fund to help a speaker get to FOSDEM on our[ Open Collective here](https://opencollective.com/opensourcedesign)

You can also donate your time or funds to help open source design make the most of FOSDEM. See our section below for how to volunteer and see our [Open Collective for how to donate](https://opencollective.com/opensourcedesign)


## Where is it?

**In person:** FOSDEM 2025 will take place at the [UniversitÃ© Libre de Bruxelles](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/13699100) in Brusells, Belgium. The ULB website has lots of info about [how to get there](https://www.ulb.be/en/solbosch/directions#deplacements). The Open Source Design devroom has yet to have a room assigned, please check back later! This [map of the campus](https://www.ulb.be/en/maps-directions/solbosch) is helpful.

**Remote:** All FOSDEM talks are being livestreamed, so you can watch them from anywhere in the world! Come back later for the link to the Open Source Design devroom on the FOSDEM livestream page(#). You can also ask questions during the Q&A sessions from there!

There is also a [chat](https://chat.fosdem.org/) for FOSDEM where you can hang out with other remote attendees and grab a virtual drink, and of course, you can always find us on Mastodon [@opensourcedesign@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@opensourcedesign), Twitter [@opensrcdesign](https://twitter.com/opensrcdesign), and [Discourse](https://discourse.opensourcedesign.net).


## When do I need to be there?

The Open Source Design FOSDEM Devroom will run for the afternoon (from 13.00pm CET) on Sunday 2nd of February. Keep an eye on the [schedule](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/design/) to make sure you don't miss your favourite talk once published!

Besides the actual talks, we are also going to be hanging out in main cafeteria for some chitchat, casual conversations and we're also waiting to know if we have a stand at FOSDEM 2025.

## How do I get involved?

We're glad you asked! You can help in many ways, including managing the crowd and making sure the room is not exceeding capacity, covering the event on social media, moderating and helping out in the chat rooms, and anything else! [Please respond to this forum post to indicate your interest to volunteer]([https://cloud.opensourcedesign.net/s/d9jsa3EDJWAKKHG](https://discourse.opensourcedesign.net/t/fosdem-2025-lets-get-a-head-start-on-planning/3891/19)).
Sadly we cannot fund volunteer travel, visa applications or accomodation.

## Any questions?

Check out the [FOSDEM FAQ](https://fosdem.org/2024/faq/) if you have any questions about attending or send a message on the [Open Source Design Discourse forum](https://discourse.opensourcedesign.net) and we will help you out.

Excited to see you there!
