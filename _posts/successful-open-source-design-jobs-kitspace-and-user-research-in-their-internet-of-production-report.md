# Successful Open Source Design jobs: Kitspace and User research in their Internet of production report

Recently we spoke with a project that had previously advertised a need for designers on our [Jobs page](https://opensourcedesign.net/jobs/) and had great success! 
We also managed to speak with the designer that had been involved in order to understand where they were coming from and how participating and contributing to open source helped them and their career goals.
The Project was [Kitspace](https://kitspace.org/) and they were looking for [“help to improve the user experience for a new user who wants to add a new project to Kitspace.”](https://github.com/opensourcedesign/jobs/blob/master/jobs/2019-02-05-design-and-testing-of-user-adding-new-project-user-journey-for-kitspaceorg.md). 
They ended up getting help from a Designer, Kenza who in “September 2021… was transitioning from luxury retail expert and trainer to UX designer. 
I was set to begin my master's degree at the same time. I wanted to volunteer in UX projects to better understand what was ahead and gain experience.”
Kenza ended up being involved in a research project with published results in a group of skilled Electronics experts.

“I took part to the IOP OKH-EC project as a UX designer alongside Kaspar, Jon, Alex and Shrouk where I mainly did research work. My main mission was to listen to interviews to gather key takeaways. 
Later, the team wrote a report on electronics repairability published in Nov 2022. You can consult it here : [https://standards.internetofproduction.org/pub/iop-ec-report-nov-2022](https://standards.internetofproduction.org/pub/iop-ec-report-nov-2022%E2%80%9D*)”
Years afterwards we at Open Source Design were doing our routine maintenance of the Job Postings and contacted the Kitspace team asking if they still wanted their advert for design help up on the website. 
They mentioned the success and benefits of having designers involved in the Internet of Production project and while they wanted to close their job posting for now, this was because they wanted to construct more specific and detailed tasks for designers for the future.

As a [core member of Open Source Design](https://discourse.opensourcedesign.net/t/open-source-design-core-team/888) It’s a joyful experience to be able to mention and publish this successful interaction between OSS developers/projects and designers. We are committed to making sure there's space on the big open internet for developers in OSS projects to discover, interact with and collaborate with designers that are involved in OSS and we hope to continue to support as many OSS projects and designers in the future.
If you’d like to talk about how design/designers have been involved in your OSS projects then we’d love to hear from you and include your experiences, good, not so good and everything in between you can email us on [core@opensourcedesign.net](core@opensourcedesign.net).
